Welcome to the Earth Observation Data Visualisation series. This repository will act as a place to collect examples of Earth observation data visualisation generated and/or shown throughout the webinars. It will continue to grow and evolve as the webinar series proceeds and will eventually also host the source material for our "best practice guide".

## Contents

This repository contains **both** the presentations provided throughout the webinar series and the best practice guide. The best practice guide is embedded as a *git submodule*, and so can be cloned separately if required.
